<h2 id="section1" class="section">Morning.</a></h2>
<h3 class="time"><time>6:30</time>-<time>7:00</time></h3>
<p>
  I wake up to at least one adorable child climbing on top of me and making enough noise to prevent me from even thinking about
  going back to sleep. I get up and prepare coffee for myself and a bottle for my 10-month-old, Emry. Next I
  prepare something for my three-year-old, Milo. Here are just a few things Milo might request for breakfast:
  <ul>
    <li>chocolate cereal</li>
    <li>green cereal</li>
    <li>chicken nuggets</li>
    <li>eggs</li>
    <li>fruit snacks</li>
    <li>ice cream</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3 class="time"><time>9:00am</time></h3>
<p>
  Around his time I have to start getting ready for work, I have a number of things that need to be done before
  I go so that my kids will be ready to be watched by my mother-in-law, such as
  <ul>
    <li>wash bottles</li>
    <li>mix a pitcher of formula</li>
    <li>straighten up the living room</li>
    <li>pack a snack</li>
    <li>change diapers</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2 id="section2" class="section">Work.</h2>
<h3 class="time"><time>10:35am</time></h3>
<p>
  I arrive at work, I do massage in a gym at a large corporation. When I walk in I get the treatment room
  ready and turn the table warmer on so that it's ready for my first client. Then I pull the files for the
  clients I'm going to see today, and read over the notes taken from their
  previous sessions (assuming the therapist who worked on them previously writes legibly).
   I check my email and Google calender apps so that I'll know if my schedule changes.

</p>

<h3 class="time"><time>11:00am</time></h3>
<p>
  My first client arrives, I take her into the treatment room and ask her a few questions in order to plan
  out her treatment. I leave the room and allow her to get ready
   & onto the table. When I come back in I ask
  my client if she's comfortable and make adjustments as needed.
  At the end of the session I leave to wash up while the client
  gets dressed. When she comes out I check in with her about
  how's she's feeling and let her know if I have any reccommendations.
  She leaves a tip & heads up front to pay for the service while
  I write my notes on the session. I then go in and "flip the room" in this order
  <ol>
    <li>
      changing the sheets and face cradle cover
    </li>
    <li>
      wiping down any surface I may have touched during the session
      (door, light switch, stool, bolster, etc)
    </li>
    <li>
      taking the dirty sheets to the hampers
    </li>

  </ol>
</p>
<h3 class="time"><time>12:45pm-3:30</time></h3>
<p>
  I do two more massages and when I'm done I refile the client files,
   lock up the massage area, and take the dirty sheets to the laundry room.
</p>

<h2 id="section3" class="section">Evening.</h2>
<h3 class="time"><time>4:30</time></h3>
<p>
  I arrive home, my husband is here now and at least two of my three kids are happy to see me
  and they demand all of my attention. They tend to get it, they're pretty cute.
  I attempt to relax but it doesn't last long.
</p>
<h3 class="time"><time>5:30</time></h3>
<p>
  My husband, Jimmy, makes dinner and then we try to watch a tv show with Oscar.
Milo is running around pretending to be Spider-man and Emry is trying to take everyone's food.
</p>
<h3 class="time"><time>6:45</time></h3>
<p>
  Jimmy and I get Milo and Emry ready for bed. Jimmy goes and puts Milo to bed
  while I get Emry to sleep. We ask Oscar to get ready for bed three times before he goes to brush his teeth &
  then he lays in bed and reads a book.
</p>
<h3 class="time"><time>9:00</time></h3>
<p>
  Jimmy and I are finally able to watch <a href="https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/pose">Pose</a> together. Oscar gets up at least
  three times to tell us he can't sleep/needs water.
</p>
<h3 class="time"><time>11:00pm</time></h3>
<p>
  Everyone is asleep, we can finally go to bed. Oh wait, Emry just woke up.
